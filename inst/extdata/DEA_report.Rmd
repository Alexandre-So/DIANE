This report was automatically generated by [DIANE](https://oceanecsn.github.io/DIANE) to improve research reproducibility.

It contains the main settings and results for the DEA tab of the application, and the last contrast that was tested.


# Your settings

Reference and perturbation condition :
```{r}
paste(r$ref, r$trt)
```


Threshold adjusted p-value and minimal expected abolute log fold change :
```{r}
paste("FDR =", r$fdr, "LFC = ", r$lfc)
```


# Results


EdgeR statistical model:
```{r}
r$fit
```


Number of upregulated genes :
```{r}
nrow(r$gene_table[r$gene_table$Regulation == "Up",])
```

Number of downregulated genes :
```{r}
nrow(r$gene_table[r$gene_table$Regulation == "Down",])
```


DEGs preview :
```{r}
head(r$gene_table, n = 40)
```

The entire table is downloadable from the application as a csv file.



# Plots

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
DIANE::draw_DEGs(r$tags, fdr = r$fdr, lfc = r$lfc, MA = TRUE)
DIANE::draw_DEGs(r$tags, fdr = r$fdr, lfc = r$lfc, MA = FALSE)
```

## GO enrichment analysis

If you performed GO enrichment analysis, you can directly download the result dataframe from the GO analysis in the application.
