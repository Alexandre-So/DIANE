RNA-Seq expriments from different published studies are gathered here.
Most of them were found in the [Expression Atlas]("https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home").

[](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/resources/images/expression-atlas.png)

You can download them to see the expected file format in DIANE for your organism, and/or upload them in the app direclty, without any further formatting needed.

Make sure to disable the “Demo data” option in the Import data tab, and then to chose the correct organism before uploading. 
All of the files are comma separated.
