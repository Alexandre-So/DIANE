<p>In addition to the Graphical User Interface, DIANE also comes with
all it’s server-side functions. They can be called from any R
environment or scripts, after loading DIANE.</p>
<p>Using DIANE’s functions outside of the interface can be an
interesting option for several reasons, among which :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It allows more flexibility and additional user-specific R
analysis</p></li>
<li><p>It can be part of an automated pipeline</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We present in this document how to use those functions on our demo
data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="input-data">Input data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#input-data"></a>
</h2>
<p>DIANE’s companion dataset is meant to illustrate its functionalities
and provide an explicit example of the expected input data.</p>
<p>The chosen dataset contains the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana
plants exposed to global warming related conditions. It was generated
for the article “Molecular plant responses to combined abiotic stresses
put a spotlight on unknown and abundant genes”, by Sewelam et Al. in
Journal of experimental Botany, 2020. (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jxb/eraa250/5842162#204457392" class="external-link uri">https://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jxb/eraa250/5842162#204457392</a>).</p>
<p>The experimental perturbations studied are heat, salinity and drought
in culture soil. Each factors have two levels, one of them considered as
the reference, and the other one as the stress level.</p>

<p>To use DIANE’s functions on your data, you should provide R variables
that describe your dataset the following formats.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="raw-expression-counts">Raw expression counts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#raw-expression-counts"></a>

<p>It must be an R dataframe with gene IDs as rownames, and
condition_replicate as columns. It contains row or normalized expression
levels.</p>
<p>In order for your input to be compatible with the proposed organisms
for GO terms and annotation, it should contain gene IDs as follow :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For Arabidopsis thaliana : TAIR IDs (ex: AT1G01020, or
AT1G01020.1)</p></li>
<li><p>For Human : ensembl IDs (ex: ENSG00000005513)</p></li>

<p>This is optional, and only used to fit Poisson Generalized linear
models to gene clusters. It is shown here to explain our companion
dataset.</p>
<p>For each condition name, the level of the factors corresponding to
that condition in your study are to be provided.</p>
<p>The experiement we chose for our demo included 3 factors, heat stress
(H), mannitol stress(M), as well as salinity stress (S).</p>
<p>You should first identify which level of each factor can be
considered as the <strong>control</strong> level, and which is a
<strong>perturbation</strong>. In our demo, the control condition is
referred to as C. Then, the perturbation are specified by their
corresponding letter, from simple to triple stress combination. For
example, SH corresponds to salt and heat stresses in the control level
of mannitol. As a consequence, its levels would be 1,0,1.</p>
<p>The design file is thus a matrix with condition names as rownames,
and factor names as columns:</p>

<h3 id="normalization">Normalization<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#normalization"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://rdrr.io/bioc/TCC" class="external-link">TCC R package</a> is used for
the normalization step here, to make samples comparable by correcting
for their differences in <strong>sequencing depths</strong>. This step
is mandatory before further statistical analysis.</p>
<p>You can choose to normalize using the methods implemented in edgeR,
referenced as ‘tmm’, or the one used in DESeq, referenced as
‘deseq2’.</p>
<p>Those normalization methods rely on the hypothesis that a very small
proportion of genes are differentially expressed between your samples.
If you suspect a lot of genes could be differentially expressed in your
data, TCC offers the possibility to proceed to a first detection of
potential differentially expressed genes, to remove them, and then
provide a final less biased normalization.</p>
<p>In that case, enable “prior removal of deferentially expressed
genes”. TCC will perform the following setp, depending on the
normalization method you chose :</p>
<p>+ tmm/deseq2 temporary normalization</p>
<p>+ potential DEG identification and removal using edgeR test
method</p>
<p>+ tmm/deseq2 definitive normalization</p>
<p>We use here the default parameters (no prior removal of
differentially expressed genes, and TMM method) :</p>

<h3 id="low-counts-removal">Low counts removal<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#low-counts-removal"></a>
</h3>
<p>Removing genes with very low abundance is a common practice in
RNA-Seq analysis pipelines for several reasons :</p>
<ul>
<li>They have little biological significance, and could be caused either
by noise or mapping errors.</li>
<li>The statistical modeling we are planning to perform next is not well
suited for low counts, as they make the mean-variance relationship
harder to estimate.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no absolute and commonly accepted threshold value, but it is
recommended to allow only genes with more than 10 counts per sample in
average. DIANE thus proposes a threshold at 10*sampleNumber, but feel
free to experiment with other values depending on your dataset and
intensions.</p>

<p>Performing PCA on normalized RNA-Seq counts can be really informative
about the conditions that impact gene expression the most. During PCA,
new variables are computed, as linear combinations of your initial
variables (e.g. experimental conditions). Those new variables, also
called principal components, are designed to carry the maximum of the
data variability.</p>
<p>We can plot the correlations of the initial variables to the
principal components, to see which ones contribute the most to those
principal components, and as a consequence, to the overall expression
changes.</p>
<p>Each principal component explains a certain amount of the total
variability, and those relative percentages are shown in what is called
the screeplot.</p>

<p>The first plane, showing the first two components, is striking in the
sense that the conditions are segregated by their heat level. Indeed, we
find here that 57.3% of gene expression variability can be linked to
heat stress.</p>
<p>The second principal axis, is more correlated to osmotic stress, as
conditions with mannitol stress are opposed along this axis, carrying
12.2% of gene expression variance.</p>
<p>It is also possible, if needed, to plot only two specific components.
This could help to visualize the plot with datasets containing a lot of
conditions.</p>

</h3>
<p>Given any set of genes, we can compute which ontologies are
significantly enriched. We compare here our list of heat responsive
genes to all the genes present in our expression matrix, referred to as
background genes.</p>
<p>If the gene IDs have splicing information (e.g. the transcript
number), they must be first transformed to classic AGI terms, with the
function <code>get_locus</code>, which is the case here.</p>
<p>The package used behind the enrichment analysis function is
clusterProfiler. The method uses Fischer test to detect significant GO
terms, and they can be either seen as a result dataframe, or in an
interactive plot :</p>

<p>We can limit the number of plotted GO terms with the max go
parameter.</p>
<p>As expected, the GO term with the higher gene count is “response to
heat”. Then, we also observe GO terms linked to oxygen levels and
hypoxia, protein folding and degradation, and responses to various other
stresses or compounds.</p>

</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/coseq/inst/doc/coseq.html" class="external-link">coseq
package</a> relies on the statistical framework of <strong>mixture
models</strong>. Each cluster of genes is represented by a Poisson or
Gaussian distribution, which parameters is estimated using
Expectation-Maximisation algorithms. In the end of the procedure, the
number of clusters that maximizes the clustering quality is chosen.</p>
<p>The input genes of a clustering can’t be all the genes of the data,
we use the output of differential expression analysis instead.</p>
<p>You can also specify a subset of the conditions to be used during the
clustering if we’re not interested in all the conditions.</p>

</h3>
<p>The idea is to extract the importance and effect of each factor. To
do so, the expression of each gene is modeled by a Poisson distribution.
The log of its parameter (the expected value) is approximated by a
linear combination of the factors in the experiment. The coefficients
associated to each factors are estimated to fit gene expression, and can
be insightful to characterize genes behavior in a particular cluster.
The model with interactions is considered automatically. If your design
in not a complete crossed design, the interaction term will be null.</p>
<p>The absolute value of a coefficient gives information about the
intensity of its effect on gene expression. The highest coefficient(s)
are thus the one(s) having the greater impact on a cluster’s expression
profile.</p>
<p>The sign of a coefficient gives information about the way it impacts
expression. If it is positive, it increases the expression when the
factor is in its perturbation level. If negative, it decreases it.</p>

<p>This step is optional, but highly recommended, before the network
inference step. Indeed, to leave strong correlations between the
inference variables (the regulators), can lead to lose edges. For
example, if two regulators are extremely correlated, one could “steal”
targets from the other one, that would lose connections to potential
target genes, that would be made if the first regulator was not in the
dataset.</p>
<p>The information of strongly correlated regulators, is already, in
itself, quite insightful and can lead to interesting biological
interpretation.</p>

</h4>
<p>Network inference takes as input a list of genes, generated by
differential expression tests, that will be the nodes of the inferred
network. Among those genes, some must be identified as potential
transcriptional regulators. It is also possible to use a subset of genes
for network inference, as clusters determined in the expression based
clustering tab.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012776" class="external-link">GENIE3
package</a> is a method based on Machine Learning (Random Forests) to
infer regulatory links between target genes and regulator genes. The
advantages of this method is that it returns oriented edges from
regulators to targets, which is desired in the context of regulatory
networks, and can capture high order interactions between
regulators.</p>
<p>For each target gene, the methods uses Random Forests to provide a
ranking of all regulators based on their influence on the target
expression. This ranking is then merged across all targets, giving a
global regulatory links ranking. Settings relative to regulatory weights
inference are presented in the left pane.</p>
<p>The idea is then to keep the strongest links to build the gene
regulatory network. The way of determining the right number of final
edges in the network can be based on a desired network density alone, or
followed by edges statistical testing.</p>

<p>Then, we are going to generate a first network, by considering only
the number of pairs offering a state of the art density value. The
density is usually between 0.1 and 0.001, as reviewed in several papers
about biological network topology. This step is crucial, as it prevents
from testing all possible pairs, which would be useless for a huge
majority of pairs, as well as extremely costly.</p>

<p>Given this graph, we can consider that a density value of 0.03 would
be a good compromise between a small enough subset of edges to test, and
a coherent density value, not too restrictive. This step will take a
certain time to run, from a few minutes to tens of minutes depending on
your hardware.</p>

<p>The first graph shows, in red, the edges that were not significant
according to our perumtation tests.</p>
<p>A community discovery is performed using the Louvain algorithm, so we
can extract highly connected genes modules. You can see those
communities on the graph and plot their profiles:</p>
<p>Gene ontology enrichment can also be performed on gene communities,
whereas they must contain quite a lot of genes. If there is too few
genes, GO enrichment tests may not be significant.</p>
