This report was automatically generated by [DIANE](https://oceanecsn.github.io/DIANE) to improve research reproducibility.

It contains the main settings and results for the clustering tab of the application.

If you're interested in one particular cluster, you can download the csv table of the genes from this cluster in the tab "explore clusters".

# Your settings

Input genes for clustering :
```{r}
r$genes
```


Conditions used for the clustering :
```{r}
r$conditions
```

Number of clusters tested :
```{r}
paste("min =", input$min_k, "max =", input$max_k )
```

Statistical model :
```{r}
r$model
```


# Results


Plots generated by the coseq run :
```{r}
draw_coseq_run(r$model, plot = "ICL")
draw_coseq_run(r$model, plot = "barplots")
```

Normalized expression profiles of the clusters:
```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
draw_profiles(
      data = r$normalized_counts,
      conds = r$conditions,
      membership = r$membership
    )
```
