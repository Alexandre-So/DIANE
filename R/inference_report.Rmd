This report was automatically generated by [DIANE](https://oceanecsn.github.io/DIANE) to improve research reproducibility.

It contains the main settings and results for the network inference tab of the application.


# Your settings


## Biological question

Input genes for clustering (deferentially expressed genes) :
```{r}
r$genes
```


Conditions used for the inference :
```{r}
r$conditions
```

## Regulators

How many regulators were found among the input genes :
```{r}

```



## Grouping correlated regulators


The regulators that were correlated above this threshold were grouped :
```{r}
r$model
```

The grouping was performed using the modules of this correlation network :
```{r}

```


Before grouping :
```{r}

```

After grouping :
```{r}

```


## Inference

Number of trees used for the inference :
```{r}

```


Importance metric used for the inference : 
```{r}

```


## Fully connected weighted networj thresholding


Selected network density and corresponding number of edges :
```{r}

```


Was statistical testing performed:
```{r}

```


# Results


Number of nodes and number of edges of the network :
```{r}

```

Number of identified modules :
```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}

```

Profiles of the modules :
