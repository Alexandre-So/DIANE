\title{Computes enrich Gene Ontology terms in a set of genes}
\usage{
enrich_go(
  genes,
  background,
  org = org.At.tair.db::org.At.tair.db,
  sim_cutoff = 0.85
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genes}{gene set of interest. MUST be entrez IDs.}

\item{background}{gene set considered as the "universe" against which perfom 
the tests. MUST be entrez IDS.}

\item{org}{organism, in the format of bioconductor organisms databases (e.g 
org.xx.xx.db)}

\item{sim_cutoff}{similarity cutoff to use for pooling similar GO terms}
}
\value{
data.frame
}
\description{
This function returns the enriched biological processes
in a set of genes, as compared to a background set of genes.
The GO terms are retreived by the clusterProfiler package and the
bioconductor organism databases (for example org.At.tair.db).
The frequencies comparisons between GO terms in the genes of interest and the 
background are performed using Fischer tests, with 0.05 adjusted pvalues
threshold. Those significantly enriched GO terms are then simplified 
with a semantic similarity threshold that can be chosen. It returns a
dataframe containing, for each significant GO, their gene count, gene symbols,
adjusted pvalue, description, etc.
